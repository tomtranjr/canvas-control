    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Context: Medical data from patients in the ER. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple timepoints observed per patient. Some of the predictors are constant in time, some are dynamic. The responses y_1 and y_2 are the measurements of indicators of health (e.g.  arterial pressure, heart rate) recorded after a 5 minute gap from the predictors. These responses are usually a sign of whether someone's condition is deterioriating to an extreme point. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a model to predict these values so we can know when someone's condition is at risk 5 minutes before it actually happens. Your task for this project is to build a machine learning model which takes in the predictors and returns predictions for y_1 and y_2. At each of the checkpoints (2/17 at 11:59p, 3/2 at 11:59p, and 3/11 at 11:59p) you will use your model to predict the 2 responses for a test set. Your relative performance (based on MAE) compared to your competitors will dictate part of your score for the project. \n"

    "    - Components of the blog:\n",
    "    - Sections separated by checkpoint and what models you had explored at that point /5\n",
